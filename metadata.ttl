    dcterms:description """This is a timestamped stream of weather data collected with a Davis Vantage Pro 2 weather station installed on the building of the [Systems Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences](https://www.ibspan.waw.pl/en/home/). The data was collected during the [ASSIST-IoT Horizon 2020 project](https://assist-iot.eu/). The station measured several different weather parameters and transmitted them in real time at regular intervals. The measurements have rich annotations with the [SOSA/SSN](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) and [OM 2.0](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/page/om-2) ontologies. The stream is very regular and the elements only differ by numeric values and timestamps. This is the graph variant, which is a timestamped graph stream compatible with the RSP Data Model.
    
The dataset is a real application of RDF streaming (originally streamed over MQTT), with much richer annotations than [citypulse-traffic](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/citypulse-traffic). On the other hand, it is perfectly regular, with no differences in structure between stream elements."""@en ;
